            <p class="text-align-justify">In a 2020 study, Hermes Investment Management found that companies with good or improving ESG characteristics, on average, outperform companies with poor or worsening characteristics.1 More recently, in 2022’s volatile markets, the broad Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Index outperformed its parent index, the Morningstar U.S. Large-Mid Cap Index, falling 18.09% compared with the latter’s 19.5% decline. It also outperformed the S&P 500 Index, which dropped 19.4% during the same time period.2 BofA Global Research, meanwhile, finds strong connections between diversity in leadership teams and higher corporate revenue related to innovation.3

                In addition, a sustainable and impact investing framework could potentially help provide a buffer for your portfolio from companies whose products or practices may expose them to fines, reputational damage, difficulty retaining employees, or other problems. “These factors introduce risks that investors need to consider,” 
                Gradovich says. Of 17 bankruptcies among S&P 500 companies from 2005 to 2015, 15 (90%) involved organizations with histories of poor environmental and social scores,
